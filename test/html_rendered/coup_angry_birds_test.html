            <p>Counteractions operate like character actions. Players may claim to influence any of the characters and use their abilities to counteract another player. They may be telling the truth or bluffing.</p>
            
            <p>They do not need to show any cards unless challenged. Counteractions may be challenged, but if not challenged they automatically succeed. If an action is successfully counteracted, the action fails but any coins paid as the cost of the action remain spent.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        
        <p>Any action or counteraction using character influence can be challenged.</p>
        
        <p>Any other player can issue a challenge to a player regardless of whether they are involved in the action.</p>
        
        <p>Once an action or counteraction is declared other players must be given an opportunity to challenge. Once play continues challenges cannot be retroactively issued.</p>
        
        <p>If a player is challenged they must prove they had the required influence by showing the relevant character is one of their face-down cards. If they can't, or do not wish to, prove it, they lose the challenge. If they can, the challenger loses.</p>
        
        <p>Whoever loses the challenge immediately loses an influence.</p>
        
        <p>If a player wins a challenge by showing the relevant character card, they first return that card to the Court deck, re-shuffle the Court deck and take a random replacement card.</p>
        
        <p>(That way they have not lost influence and other players do not know the new influence card they have). Then the action or counteraction is resolved.</p>
        
        <p>If an action is successfully challenged the entire action fails, and any coins paid as the cost of the action are returned to the player.</p>

        <p>It is possible to lose 2 influence in one turn if you unsuccessfully defend against an assassination.</p>
        
        <p>For example, if you challenge an assassin used against you and lose the challenge, you will lose 1 influence for the lost challenge and then 1 influence for the successful assassination.</p>
        
        <p>Or if you bluff about having the Contessa to block an assassination attempt and are challenged, you will lose 1 influence for the lost challenge and then lose 1 influence for the successful assassination.</p>

        <p>Divide the cards into a 3 sets of 5 (each set has one of each character). Each player takes one set, secretly chooses one card and discards the rest.</p>
        
        <p>Shuffle the third set and deal one card to each player and then put the remaining three cards face down as the court deck.</p>
