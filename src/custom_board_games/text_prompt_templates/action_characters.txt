Generate the configuration and wording for the instructions of this new board game {{new_game_name}} by filling out the rest of the provided JSON jinja template,

You should output a JSON-parseable file, which would allow a program to autopopulate the webpage for the game.
You should act as a Jinja template formatter, and only change fields in jinja double curly braces.
The one exception to this is that for each field corresponding to a shared object suffixed with an integer, you should generate as many of copies of these as there are corresponding components in the game.
For instance, if you see {%raw%}{{character1.name}}{%endraw%} in an array, and there are 3 characters in the created game, you should generate {%raw%}[{{character1.name}}, {{character2.name}}, {{character3.name}}]{%endraw%}
Sometimes inside Jinja curly braces are regexes, such as this one for color hex: r"^([A-Fa-f0-9]{6}|[A-Fa-f0-9]{3})$". When you encounter these, you should generate output that satisfies the regex. In this case, an example is #2CA6C0
 

This board game uses the exact same rules as the existing game {{original_game_name}}, but all the characters and terminology are generated by you and match the theme & story you already generated.
