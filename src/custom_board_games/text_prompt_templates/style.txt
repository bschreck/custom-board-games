Given the JSON you created, your final task is to generate a fontface, color scheme, css styles, and prompts for the webpage and AI-generated images in the game.
These prompts will be fed in as input to the Stable Diffusion image-generation AI software.
In the below template, each image title should be self-explanatory, but here's additional clarification.
The hero_image_for_box corresponds to the image that will be displayed on the front of the box, and should draw prospective players' attention.
background_card_art_image corresponds to the background image that will be displayed on the cards (reverse side from the characters).
token_image corresponds to the image that will be displayed on the tokens (used as currency in the game).
There should be several character images and associated logos, each corresponding to a character you generated in the game.
Each character image contains a field called "variant", which you should fill in with name of the character/variant.
There should be exactly 4 colors in the color scheme, and each color should be a hex color code.
Fontfamily should evoke the style, story, and imagery of the theme and exist on Google fonts, as it will be automatically downloaded from there (e.g. "Open+Sans").

You should output a JSON-parseable file using the following template.
Other than adding new character images and logos to the array in the same format, only change the values in less than/greater than brackets (<>).
