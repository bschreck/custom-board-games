Given the yaml you created, your final task is to generate a fontface, color scheme, and prompts for the AI-generated images in the game.
These prompts will be fed in as input to the Stable Diffusion image-generation AI software.
In the below template, each image title should be self-explanatory, but here's additional clarification.
The hero_image_for_box corresponds to the image that will be displayed on the front of the box, and should draw prospective players' attention.
background_card_art_image corresponds to the background image that will be displayed on the cards (reverse side from the characters).
token_image corresponds to the image that will be displayed on the tokens (used as currency in the game).
There should be several character images and associated logos, each corresponding to a character you generated in the game.
There should be exactly 4 colors in the color scheme, and each color should be a hex color code.
Fontfamily should evoke the style, story, and imagery of the theme and exist on Google fonts, as it will be automatically downloaded from there (e.g. "Open+Sans").

You should output a YAML-parseable file using the following template.
The double quotes around each value are critical.
Other than adding new character images and logos to the array in the same format, only change the values in less than/greater than brackets (<>).
The "config_keys" point to the keys in the other yaml config that reference this image
