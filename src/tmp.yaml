          challenged, but if not challenged they automatically succeed. If an action is
          successfully counteracted, the action fails but any coins paid as the cost of
          the action remain spent.

  overview:
    - A player may choose any action they want and can afford. Some actions (Character
      Actions) require influencing characters.
    - If they choose a Character Action a player must claim that the required character
      is one of their face down cards. They can be telling the truth or bluffing. They
      do not need to reveal any of their face down cards unless they are challenged.
      If they are not challenged they automatically succeed.
    - If a player starts their turn with 10 (or more) coins they must acquire a coffee shop
      that turn as their only action.
challenges:
  text:
    - Any action or counteraction using character influence can be challenged.
    - Any other player can issue a challenge to a player regardless of whether they
      are involved in the action.
    - Once an action or counteraction is declared other players must be given an opportunity
      to challenge. Once play continues challenges cannot be retroactively issued.
    - If a player is challenged they must prove they had the required influence by showing
      the relevant character is one of their face-down cards. If they can't, or do not
      wish to, prove it, they lose the challenge. If they can, the challenger loses.
    - Whoever loses the challenge immediately loses an influence.
    - If a player wins a challenge by showing the relevant character card, they first
      return that card to the Market deck, re-shuffle the Market deck and take a random
      replacement card.
    - (That way they have not lost influence and other players do not know the new influence
      card they have). Then the action or counteraction is resolved.
    - If an action is successfully challenged the entire action fails, and any coins
      paid as the cost of the action are returned to the player.

  text:
    - On your turn, you can take any of the actions listed on the action list, provided
      you can afford it. Actions can be challenged by any other player, and bluffs can
      be called. If you lose a challenge, you lose an influence.
    - After the action is chosen other players have an opportunity to challenge or counteract
      that action.
    - If an action is not challenged or counteracted, the action automatically succeeds.
      Challenges are resolved first before any action or counteraction is resolved.
    - When a player has lost all their influence and both their cards are face up in
      front of them, they are immediately out of the game. They leave their cards face
      up and return all their coins to the Bank.
    - The game ends when there is only one player left.

notes:
  note1:
    title: Influence
    text:
      - Facedown cards in front of a player represent who they influence in the market. The characters printed on their face down cards represents which characters that player influences and their abilities.
      - Every time a player loses an influence they have to turn over and reveal one of their face down cards. Revealed cards remain face up in front of the player visible to everyone and no longer provide influence for the player.
      - Each player always chooses which of their own cards they wish to reveal when they lose an influence.
      - When a player has lost all their influence they are bankrupt and out of the game.
  note2:
    - class: market-volatility
      text:
        - It is possible to lose 2 influence in one turn if you lose a market battle.
        - For example, if you challenge an entrepreneur entering your market and lose the challenge, you will lose 1 influence for the lost challenge and 1 influence from the successful market disruption.
        - Or if you bluff about having the regulator to block a market entry and are challenged, you will lose 1 influence for the lost challenge and then lose 1 influence due to the successful market entry.
