Your goal is to alter the provided gameplay instructions to create a new game with the exact same rules.

Story

In the not too distant future, the government is run for profit by a new "royal class" of multinational CEOs.

Their greed and absolute control of the economy has reduced all but a privileged few to lives of poverty and desperation.

Out of the oppressed masses rose The Resistance, an underground organization focused on overthrowing these powerful rulers. The valiant efforts of

The Resistance have created discord, intrigue, and weakness in the political courts of the noveau royal, bringing the government to brink of collapse. But for you, a powerful government official, this is your opportunity to manipulate, bribe and bluff your way into absolute power.

To be successful, you must destroy the influence of your rivals and drive them into exile.

In these turbulent times there is only room for one to survive.

Components

3 Duke Cards
3 Assassin Cards
3 Captain Cards
3 Ambassador Cards
3 Contessa Cards
6 summary cards
50 coins

Setup
Shuffle all the character cards and deal 2 to each player. Players can always look at their cards but must keep them face down in front of them. Place the remaining cards in the middle of the play area as the Court deck.

Give each player 2 coins. Each player's money must be kept visible. Place the remaining coins in the middle of the play area as the Treasury.

Give one summary card to each player. This is for reference only. Players should familiarize themselves with all the actions and characters before starting the game.
The person who won the last game starts.

Object of the Game
To eliminate the influence of all other players and be the last survivor.

Influence
Facedown cards in front of a player represent who they influence at court. The characters printed on their face down cards represents which characters that player influences and their abilities.

Every time a player loses an influence they have to turn over and reveal one of their face down cards. Revealed cards remain face up in front of the player visible to everyone and no longer provide influence for the player.

Each player always chooses which of their own cards they wish to reveal when they lose an influence.

When a player has lost all their influence they are exiled and out of the game.

Game Play
The game is played in turns in clockwise order. Each turn a player chooses one action only. A player may not pass.
After the action is chosen other players have an opportunity to challenge or counteract that action.

If an action is not challenged or counteracted, the action automatically succeeds. Challenges are resolved first before any action or counteraction is resolved.

When a player has lost all their influence and both their cards are face up in front of them, they are immediately out of the game. They leave their cards face up and return all their coins to the Treasury.

The game ends when there is only one player left.

Actions
A player may choose any action they want and can afford. Some actions (Character Actions) require influencing characters.

If they choose a Character Action a player must claim that the required character is one of their face down cards. They can be telling the truth or bluffing. They do not need to reveal any of their face down cards unless they are challenged. If they are not challenged they automatically succeed.
If a player starts their turn with 10 (or more) coins they must launch a Coup that turn as their only action.

A. General Actions
(Always available)

Income
Take 1 coin from the Treasury.

Foreign Aid
Take 2 coins from the Treasury. (Can be blocked by the Duke)

Coup
Pay 7 coins to the Treasury and launch a Coup against another player. That player immediately loses an influence. A Coup is always successful. If you start your turn with 10 (or more) coins you are required to launch a Coup.

B. Character Actions
(If challenged a player must show they influence the relevant character)

Duke - Tax
Take 3 coins from the Treasury.

Assassin - Assassinate
Pay 3 coins to the Treasury and launch an assassination against another player. If successful that player immediately loses an influence. (Can be blocked by the Contessa)

Captain - Steal
Take 2 coins from another player. If they only have one coin, take only one. (Can be blocked by the Ambassador or the Captain)

Ambassador - Exchange
Exchange cards with the Court. First take 2 random cards from the Court deck. Choose which, if any, to exchange with your face-down cards. Then return two cards to the Court deck.

C. Counteractions
Counteractions can be taken by other players to intervene or block a player's action.
Counteractions operate like character actions. Players may claim to influence any of the characters and use their abilities to counteract another player. They may be telling the truth or bluffing.

They do not need to show any cards unless challenged. Counteractions may be challenged, but if not challenged they automatically succeed. If an action is successfully counteracted, the action fails but any coins paid as the cost of the action remain spent.

Duke - Blocks Foreign Aid
Any player claiming the Duke may counteract and block a player attempting to collect foreign aid.

The player trying to gain foreign aid receives no coins that turn.

Contessa - Blocks Assassination
The player who is being assassinated may claim the Contessa and counteract to block the assassination.

The assassination fails but the fee paid by the player for the assassin remains spent.

Ambassador/captain - Blocks Stealing
The player who is being stolen from may claim either the Ambassador or the Captain and counteract to block the steal.

The player trying to steal receives no coins that turn.

Challenges
Any action or counteraction using character influence can be challenged.

Any other player can issue a challenge to a player regardless of whether they are involved in the action.
Once an action or counteraction is declared other players must be given an opportunity to challenge. Once play continues challenges cannot be retroactively issued.

If a player is challenged they must prove they had the required influence by showing the relevant character is one of their face-down cards. If they can't, or do not wish to, prove it, they lose the challenge. If they can, the challenger loses.

Whoever loses the challenge immediately loses an influence.

If a player wins a challenge by showing the relevant character card, they first return that card to the Court deck, re-shuffle the Court deck and take a random replacement card.

(That way they have not lost influence and other players do not know the new influence card they have). Then the action or counteraction is resolved.

If an action is successfully challenged the entire action fails, and any coins paid as the cost of the action are returned to the player.

Story

In the not too distant future, sentient animals equipped with advanced cybernetic enhancements, fueled by quantum energy, battle for supremacy in a world driven by time technology.

Giant corporations, now run by the most powerful of these cybernetic animals, exploit quantum energy reserves to manipulate time and reality, causing widespread inequality. Only a few cybernetic animals live in the glittering neon metropolises, while the rest are relegated to the ruins of the old world.

Out of the desperate times emerges the Quantum Alliance, a group committed to toppling these powerful corporations. The Quantum Alliance's efforts have created ripples in time, causing confusion and disarray amongst the ruling class, pushing their reality to the brink of a time paradox.

For you, a highly augmented creature in a position of power, this chaotic timeline is an opportunity to harness quantum energy, trick your adversaries and bluff your way into becoming the singular ruler of time.

Your goal is to sap your rivals of their power, push them out of this timeline, and become the last survivor in this time-altering war. Only one can control the quantum stream and dictate the flow of time.
