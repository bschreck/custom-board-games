  overview:
  - A player may choose any action they want and can afford. Some actions (Character
    Actions) require influencing characters.</p>
  - If they choose a Character Action a player must claim that the required character
    is one of their face down cards. They can be telling the truth or bluffing. They
    do not need to reveal any of their face down cards unless they are challenged.
    If they are not challenged they automatically succeed.</p>
  - If a player starts their turn with 10 (or more) coins they must launch a Coup
    that turn as their only action.</p>
challenges:
  text:
  - Any action or counteraction using character influence can be challenged.
  - Any other player can issue a challenge to a player regardless of whether they
    are involved in the action.
  - Once an action or counteraction is declared other players must be given an opportunity
    to challenge. Once play continues challenges cannot be retroactively issued.
  - If a player is challenged they must prove they had the required influence by showing
    the relevant character is one of their face-down cards. If they can't, or do not
    wish to, prove it, they lose the challenge. If they can, the challenger loses.
  - Whoever loses the challenge immediately loses an influence.
  - If a player wins a challenge by showing the relevant character card, they first
    return that card to the Court deck, re-shuffle the Court deck and take a random
    replacement card.
  - (That way they have not lost influence and other players do not know the new influence
    card they have). Then the action or counteraction is resolved.
  - If an action is successfully challenged the entire action fails, and any coins
    paid as the cost of the action are returned to the player.

game_play:
  text:
  - On your turn, you can take any of the actions listed on the action list, provided
    you can afford it. Actions can be challenged by any other player, and bluffs can
    be called. If you lose a challenge, you lose an influence.
  - After the action is chosen other players have an opportunity to challenge or counteract
    that action.
  - If an action is not challenged or counteracted, the action automatically succeeds.
    Challenges are resolved first before any action or counteraction is resolved.
  - When a player has lost all their influence and both their cards are face up in
    front of them, they are immediately out of the game. They leave their cards face
    up and return all their coins to the Treasury.
  - The game ends when there is only one player left.

  note1:
  - class: influence
    text:
    - Facedown cards in front of a player represent who they influence at court. The
      characters printed on their face down cards represents which characters that
      player influences and their abilities.
    - Every time a player loses an influence they have to turn over and reveal one
      of their face down cards. Revealed cards remain face up in front of the player
      visible to everyone and no longer provide influence for the player.
    - Each player always chooses which of their own cards they wish to reveal when
      they lose an influence.
    - When a player has lost all their influence they are exiled and out of the game.
    title: Influence
  note2:
  - class: double-dangers
    text:
    - It is possible to lose 2 influence in one turn if you unsuccessfully defend
      against an assassination.
    - For example, if you challenge an assassin used against you and lose the challenge,
      you will lose 1 influence for the lost challenge and then 1 influence for the
      successful assassination.
    - Or if you bluff about having the Contessa to block an assassination attempt
      and are challenged, you will lose 1 influence for the lost challenge and then
      lose 1 influence for the successful assassination.
    title: 'Note: Double Dangers of Assassination'
  - class: lack-trust
    text:
    - Any negotiations are allowed, but none are ever binding. Players are not allowed
      to reveal any of their cards to other players.
    - No coins can be given or lent to other players.
    - There is no second place.
    title: Total (Lack of) Trust
  note3:
  - class: two-player
    text:
    - When playing Coup with two players, the starting player receives only 1 coin
      at the beginning of the game.
    - 'As a variant, Coup can be played with two players with these changes to the
      setup:'
    - Divide the cards into a 3 sets of 5 (each set has one of each character). Each
      player takes one set, secretly chooses one card and discards the rest.
    - Shuffle the third set and deal one card to each player and then put the remaining
      three cards face down as the court deck.

setup:
  image: coup_images/coup7.webp
  text:
  - Shuffle all the character cards and deal 2 to each player. Players can always
    look at their cards but must keep them face down in front of them. Place the remaining
    cards in the middle of the play area as the Court deck.
  - Give each player 2 coins. Each player's money must be kept visible. Place the
    remaining coins in the middle of the play area as the Treasury.
  - Give one summary card to each player. This is for reference only. Players should
    familiarize themselves with all the actions and characters before starting the
    game.
  - The person who won the last game starts.
story:
  text:
  - In the heart of New York City, deep beneath the storm-tossed streets, our heroes,
    Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo, are locked in a state of recovery.
    Following their last battle with Shredder, they work under the tutelage of Master
    Splinter to rebuild the strained bonds of brotherhood.
  - But peace is fleeting, especially beneath the ground. A new threat arises, plunging
    the city into chaos. Shredder may have fallen, but his legacy lives on. Various
    factions scramble to fill the power vacuum left in his wake, endangering the city
    our heroes cherish.
  - The Turtles must each gather their own allies, use their unique skills, and outwit
    both enemies and one another to ensure the protection of their home. The trust
    that held them together is now the factor that turns them separate ways.
  - "In this game, you take on the role of one of the Turtles, working to solidify
    your influence and resources in order to thwart the lingering Foot Clan\u2019s
    attempts for power while keeping the city safe. Bear in mind that only one can
    control the city\u2019s underbelly. Will you save the city, or will it descend
    into the chaos of the power-hungry?"
  - "Choose your actions wisely, strategize your alliances, and remember - in the
    end, only the most influential will rule. It\u2019s time to come out of the shadows,
    it\u2019s time to play Teenage Mutant Ninja Power Struggle."
