    - Counteractions can be taken by other players to intervene or block a player's
      action.
    - Counteractions operate like character actions. Players may claim to influence
      any of the characters and use their abilities to counteract another player.
      They may be telling the truth or bluffing.
    - They do not need to show any cards unless challenged. Counteractions may be
      challenged, but if not challenged they automatically succeed. If an action is
      successfully counteracted, the action fails but any tokens paid as the cost
      of the action remain spent.

challenges:
  text:
  - Any action or counteraction using character influence can be challenged.
  - Any other player can issue a challenge to a player regardless of whether they
    are involved in the action.
  - Once an action or counteraction is declared other players must be given an opportunity
    to challenge. Once play continues challenges cannot be retroactively issued.
  - If a player is challenged they must prove they had the required influence by showing
    the relevant character is one of their face-down cards. If they can't, or do not
    wish to, prove it, they lose the challenge. If they can, the challenger loses.
  - Whoever loses the challenge immediately loses an influence.
  - If a player wins a challenge by showing the relevant character card, they first
    return that card to the Lair deck, re-shuffle the Lair deck and take a random
    replacement card.
  - (That way they have not lost influence and other players do not know the new influence
    card they have). Then the action or counteraction is resolved.
  - If an action is successfully challenged the entire action fails, and any tokens
    paid as the cost of the action are returned to the player.

game_play:
  text:
  - On your turn, you can take any of the actions listed on the action list, provided
    you can afford it. Actions can be challenged by any other player, and bluffs can
    be called. If you lose a challenge, you lose an influence.
  - After the action is chosen other players have an opportunity to challenge or counteract
    that action.
  - If an action is not challenged or counteracted, the action automatically succeeds.
    Challenges are resolved first before any action or counteraction is resolved.
  - When a character has lost all their influence and their cards are face up in front
    of them, they are immediately out of the game. They leave their cards face up
    and return all their tokens to the Cache.
  - The game ends when there is only one character left.

  - Influence and trust are vital as you play your cards to fight against your enemies.
    Teaming up or bluffing could give you temporary advantage but remember, the one
    with the most influence would rule and the rest will be just followers.
objective:
  text:
  - To eliminate the influence of all other turtles and be the last one standing.
overview:
- A player may choose any action they want and can afford. Some actions (Character
  Actions) require influencing allies.
- If they choose a Character Action a player must claim that the required character
  is one of their face down cards. They can be telling the truth or bluffing. They
  do not need to reveal any of their face down cards unless they are challenged. If
  they are not challenged they automatically succeed.
- If a player starts their turn with 10 (or more) tokens they must execute a takedown
  that turn as their only action.
setup:
  image: tmnt_images/setup.webp
  text:
  - Shuffle all the character cards and deal 2 to each player. Players can always
    look at their cards but must keep them face down in front of them. Place the remaining
    cards in the middle of the play area as the Lair deck.
  - Give each player 2 tokens. Each player's tokens must be kept visible. Place the
    remaining tokens in the middle of the play area as the Cache.
  - Give one summary card to each player. This is for reference only. Players should
    familiarize themselves with all the actions and characters before starting the
    game.
  - The turtle who won the last game starts.
