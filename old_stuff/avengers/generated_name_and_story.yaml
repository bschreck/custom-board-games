story:
  text:
  - In the dark ages, a new class of knights emerges, granted amazing abilities by
    the mystic arts or divine favor, powers that today would be considered either
    commonplace or obsolete, but in the midst of medieval Europe seemed almost godlike.
  - Known as The Avengers, these unique individuals wield such 'powers' as the ability
    to create fire without flint, manipulate simple machinery from a distance, or
    even predict the weather with eerie accuracy.
  - As a baron or baroness among the noble elite, you watch in both awe and fear as
    these Avengers influence the ongoing wars, diplomatic relations, and the fate
    of kingdoms. However, you also see an opportunity to control these powerful figures
    for your own gain and to secure your legacy.
  - In this game of cunning and strategy, you will need to bluff, barter, and bargain
    your way into the Avengers' good graces, destroy the influence of your rivals,
    and assure your seat of power in these volatile times. Yet, remember, in the perilous
    dance for power within the medieval court, there is only room for one victor.
