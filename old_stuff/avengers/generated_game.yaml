  - descriptor:
    - Counteractions can be taken by other players to intervene or block a player's
      action.
    - Counteractions operate like avenger actions. Players may claim to influence
      any of the avengers and use their abilities to counteract another player. They
      may be telling the truth or bluffing.
    - They do not need to show any cards unless challenged. Counteractions may be
      challenged, but if not challenged they automatically succeed. If an action is
      successfully counteracted, the action fails but any gold paid as the cost of
      the action remain spent.

  text:
  - On your turn, you can take any of the actions listed on the action list, provided
    you can afford it. Actions can be challenged by any other player, and bluffs can
    be called. If you lose a challenge, you lose an influence.
  - After the action is chosen other players have an opportunity to challenge or counteract
    that action.
  - If an action is not challenged or counteracted, the action automatically succeeds.
    Challenges are resolved first before any action or counteraction is resolved.
  - When a player has lost all their influence and both their cards are face up in
    front of them, they are immediately out of the game. They leave their cards face
    up and return all their gold to the Treasury.
  - The game ends when there is only one player left.

    familiarize themselves with all the actions and characters before starting the
    game.

story:
  text:
  - In the dark ages, a new class of knights emerges, granted amazing abilities by
    the mystic arts or divine favor, powers that today would be considered either
    commonplace or obsolete, but in the midst of medieval Europe seemed almost godlike.
  - Known as The Avengers, these unique individuals wield such 'powers' as the ability
    to create fire without flint, manipulate simple machinery from a distance, or
    even predict the weather with eerie accuracy.
  - As a baron or baroness among the noble elite, you watch in both awe and fear as
    these Avengers influence the ongoing wars, diplomatic relations, and the fate
    of kingdoms. However, you also see an opportunity to control these powerful figures
    for your own gain and to secure your legacy.
  - In this game of cunning and strategy, you will need to bluff, barter, and bargain
    your way into the Avengers' good graces, destroy the influence of your rivals,
    and assure your seat of power in these volatile times. Yet, remember, in the perilous
    dance for power within the medieval court, there is only room for one victor.
